### Sentiment Analysis of Reddit Discussions Around Apple and Meta Stocks

### Abstract

This project investigates the relationship between online sentiment and stock performance, focusing on Apple and Meta as case studies. Leveraging Reddit discussions on r/WallStreetBets, we applied sentiment analysis, word frequency analysis, and TF-IDF techniques to explore how retail investor sentiment aligns with long-term stock price trends. The analysis revealed a strong correlation between positive sentiment in online discussions and sustained stock price growth for both companies. Frequently used terms like "buy," "growth," and "long-term" indicated optimism and confidence in these stocks, which were reflected in their consistent price increases over a six-month period.

The findings underscore the growing influence of online communities in shaping financial markets and offer valuable insights for investors and analysts. By combining social media sentiment with stock performance data, this study highlights the potential of using non-traditional data sources to understand market dynamics and predict future trends. 

While the study provides compelling evidence of sentiment-driven market behavior, its scope is limited to two companies and a specific time frame. Future research should expand the dataset, incorporate more companies, and apply advanced modeling techniques to enhance the validity and applicability of the results. This project demonstrates the value of integrating sentiment analysis into financial research for deeper insights into market trends.
