### Sentiment Analysis of Reddit Discussions Around Apple and Meta Stocks

#### Abstract  
Retail investors have increasingly become a significant force in the financial markets, with platforms like Reddit's r/WallStreetBets acting as critical hubs for discussing stock trends and market sentiment. This project explores the relationship between sentiment in Reddit discussions and the long-term stock performance of Apple and Meta, focusing on data from six months before and after earnings calls. By leveraging methods such as word frequency analysis, TF-IDF, sentiment analysis, and visualization techniques, this study aims to understand how online sentiment reflects and potentially predicts stock price movements. The findings provide valuable insights into the growing influence of retail investor communities on market dynamics and emphasize the potential of social media sentiment as a tool for financial analysis. Future studies could enhance the robustness of these results by incorporating additional data sources and extending the scope of analysis.
